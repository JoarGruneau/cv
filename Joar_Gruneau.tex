\section{Work experience}
\cventry{2019-current}{Crypto currency trading engine}{}{}{}{I single-handedly developed and launched a fully automated machine learning crypto currency trading engine. The engine currently trades on Binance's spot and futures exchanges. During this project I enhanced my knowledge of python development, machine learning and pytorch, automated trading through APIs, data scraping and data base management in noSQL (mongodb).}
\cventry{2018}{Software developer}{BlackRock}{}{}{I worked in two teams during
  my time with BlacRock. I started out developing technologies to enhance the
  performance of the companies sales force together with the model portfolio front-end team. Working in a big international team over many different time zones teaches you to build strong teamwork skills and take ownership of your work. I was then part of the fixed income and equities risk modeling team and worked in their pursuit to decrease the new model development time cycle by bringing their models onto their new modeling platform.}
\cventry{2018}{Master Thesis}{KTH in collaboration with BlackRock}{}{}{The project performed an investigation of deep learning approaches for overhead imagery
analysis for detecting and counting vehicles. The result was a pipeline that achieved the same performance as previous state of the art models in $1/100$ of the computational time.}
\cventry{2017}{Software developer}{BlackRock}{}{}{During the summer internship at BlackRock I worked as a back-end developer with their desktop services. This gave me a very valuable insight into large scale agile software development.}
\cventry{2011--2016}{Tutor}{Studybuddy}{}{}{Taught math and physics to high school students.}
\cventry{2013--2016}{Climbing instructor}{Klattercentret}{}{}{I held climbing schools a few times a week for children of age 10 to 18. I also automated the climbing school's online queue system.}
